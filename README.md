# BRDFA_Engine
A 3D rendering engine powered by Vulkan for the purposes of analyzing different "Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function"s over environment maps. This project is part of my thesis. My thesis is about analyzing BRDFs and documenting them. <br><br>
In this engine, you can create/test/compare/tweak any BRDF you come accross. You can implement your cool BRDFs and compare it to other BRDFs. Furthermore, you can create/edit the BRDF code at run-time, view the changes, test the shader code, and save it.


 
# Engine Capabilities:
* You can write fragment shaders at real-time (Main functionality).
* You can save the current frame to a BMP file (Helpful for deep analysis).
* Many tools are supported in the engine (Testing, Validation, Objects loading ..etc), which are explained in the attached PDF (Thesis) in the repository.
* The engine is running mainly by utilizing different tools found in the "utils" folder. 
* Windows is the only supported Operating system for the application.

<h1>How to Run the Project: </h1>
<h3>There are two ways to run the project, either you clone the repo and use the CMakeList file with Visual Studio, or you can download the latest release build and skip the building process.</h3>
