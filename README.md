# BRDFA_Engine
A 3D rendering engine powered by Vulkan for the purposes of analyzing different "Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function"s over environment maps. This project is part of my thesis. My thesis is about analyzing BRDFs and documenting them. <br><br>
In this engine, you can create/test/compare/tweak any BRDF you come accross. You can implement your cool BRDFs and compare it to other BRDFs. Furthermore, you can create/edit the BRDF code at run-time, view the changes, test the shader code, and save it.

<h5>* Objects Have Plenty of Parameters to Tweak (Rendering Option is the Chosen BRDF)!</h5>
