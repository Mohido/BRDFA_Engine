# Analyzing Bidirectional Reflectance Functions
This repository hosts all the analysis and programs that are created and used in my thesis. My thesis is about analyzing bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs). 

This repository comprises two directories: BRDFA_Engine, and Matlab_Analysis. The BRDFA_Engine is the software provided with the thesis, while the Matlab_Analysis holds the analytic analysis. Both folders contain <span style="background-color:rgb(200,200,200)"><em>readme.md</em></span> file which explains what the directory is about and how to utilize it. The thesis paper work (is)/(will be) included in this repository as well.

### - BRDFA_Engine
Is a 3D rendering engine powered by Vulkan for the purposes of analyzing different "Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function"s over environment maps. 

This engine provides a sandbox testing environment for a veriaty of shading functions. The user can create/test/compare/tweak BRDFs at runtime without the need to restart the engine.

### - Matlab_Analysis
An implementation of distinct BRDFs and their visualization. Most of the graphs presented in the Thesis Paper work are provided through utilizing Matlab.
